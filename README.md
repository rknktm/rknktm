Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'am Erkan from Turkey, - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Devops Tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible as weel as language like Python.Learning new tools make me more curious and more investigative. Iâ€™m a fan of lifelong learning and personal development. I love being in the DevOps culture and I believe it will spread all over the world. I hope that soon I will be able to take my place among the employees of the industry.
